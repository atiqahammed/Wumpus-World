# Wumpus-World
The Wumpus world is a cave consisting of rooms connected by passageways. Lurking somewhere in the cave is the terrible Wumpus, a beast that eats anyone who enters its room. The Wumpus can be shot by an agent, but the agent has only one arrow. Some rooms contain bottomless pits that will trap anyone who wanders into these rooms. The only mitigating feature of this bleak environment is the possibility of finding a heap of gold. This project is developed in java.
